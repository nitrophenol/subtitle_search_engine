         That's right.          

117
00:09:12,219 --> 00:09:14,019
    Now it's just a desert.     

118
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:18,423
     No one wants to take a     
  vacation to ...desert city!   

119
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:22,794
      Aw, we're gonna lose      
    all our summer business!    

120
00:09:22,829 --> 00:09:25,664
          And all the           
        beach babes. Aw!        

121
00:09:25,699 --> 00:09:27,666
          Who's gonna           
         buy my fries?          

122
00:09:27,701 --> 00:09:28,833
         And my pizza!          

123
00:09:28,869 --> 00:09:31,536
        Who's gonna have        
        fun at funland?         

124
00:09:31,572 --> 00:09:34,906
     As Mayor, I demand you     
   explain this immediately!    

125
00:09:34,942 --> 00:09:36,942
      It was Lapis Lazuli.      

126
00:09:36,977 --> 00:09:38,710
         Lapis Lazuli?          

127
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:42,581
       She's the Gem you        
   released from the mirror.    

128
00:09:42,616 --> 00:09:43,448
       [ crowd murmurs ]        

129
00:09:43,483 --> 00:09:44,482
       That's incredible.       

130
00:09:44,518 --> 00:09:45,584
      How did you do that?      

131
00:09:45,619 --> 00:09:47,552
        But she's a Gem,        
         just like us.          

132
00:09:47,588 --> 00:09:51,456
    There's a lot you don't     
    know about Gems, Steven.    

133
00:09:51,491 --> 00:09:53,425
        How could I have        
         known the Gem          

134
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:56,761
    contained in that mirror    
     would be so powerful?      

135
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:58,530
      Where are you going,      
            Steven?             

136
00:09:58,565 --> 00:09:59,730
       I'm leaving to fix       
    what I did to our home.
